# Component Repository

This directory serves as the actual storage location for all managed components. 

Here you will find the installed components (such as km-a, km-b, etc.) along with their respective versions, organized in a structured format. Each component's files (binaries, libraries, configurations, and data) are stored according to the specifications defined in their package manifests.

The contents of this directory are managed by the kmdo tool, which handles installation, updates, and cleanup operations to ensure consistency with the configured package definitions.
